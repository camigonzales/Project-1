  <h1>Cami Gonzales - Project 1</h1> 
  <p> This is my first project, exploring the basics of HTML. In this project, I utilize my newfound knowledge of headings, lists, links, and more!  </p>

  <h2>Who I am!</h2>
  <p>My name is Cami Gonzales, and I am a Senior in the LSU Bachelor of Art program, mainly focusing on Graphic Design and Painting. 
    Here is a link to my Graphic Design <a href="https://camigonzales.myportfolio.com/" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>. 
    I have never coded before, so I am very excited and nervous to learn!
  </p>
